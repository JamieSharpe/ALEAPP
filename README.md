## Dependencies

Dependencies for your python environment are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using the below command. Ensure the `py` part is correct for your environment, eg `py`, `python`, or `python3`, etc.

`py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run on **Linux**, you will also need to install `tkinter` separately like so:

`sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
